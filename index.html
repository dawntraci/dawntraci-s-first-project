        <h2>Almost enought about me....</h2>

        <h3>My Next Career is in the Works</h3>
        
        <p>Coding is definitely another language. I feel like an entire world has opened up for me and I am immensely hopeful about my future and most grateful for the prospects. It will only be a matter of time before I become Webmaster Extrodinaire.</p>
        
        <h3> Stay Tuned</h3>
          <p> I have totally started listening to God again. (I was bit peeved with Him.) But who knew?? He so TOTALLY knew what He was doing!! (I heard He's been aroung awhile.) So stick around for a front row seat to my about-to-be-marvelous SECOND HALF. Toodles!</p>
